# 🧠 Autonomous AI Workforce for Real-World Decision Making

### *Transforming Raw Data into Executive Actions with Multi-Agent Intelligence*

---

## 🚀 Overview
This isn't just another AI script. This is an **Integrated Agentic System** designed to function as a synthetic corporation. It automates the entire lifecycle of data—from cleaning messy datasets to training predictive models and generating board-room ready reports—without human intervention.

**Live Demo:** ["https://huggingface.co/spaces/SHIVAM283893rwf/autonomous-ai-workforce"]  
**Built for:** Global Startups, FinTech, and Data-Driven Enterprises.

## 🛠️ The Architecture (The "Brain" Behind the Work)

The system operates using a **Multi-Agent Orchestration** layer where specialized AI Agents collaborate, argue, and refine outputs.



### 👥 The Synthetic Team:
1.  **🧠 The Planner Agent:** Deconstructs complex user prompts into executable technical tasks.
2.  **📊 The Data Analyst Agent:** Writes and executes Python/SQL code to perform EDA and Bias Detection.
3.  **🤖 The ML Engineer Agent:** Automatically selects the best algorithm (XGBoost/Mistral) and handles model training.
4.  **🕵️ The Critic Agent:** Audits every output for hallucinations, bias, and technical errors.
5.  **📑 The Report Writer:** Synthesizes technical data into strategic business insights (PDF/Dashboard).

## ⚡ Key Features
- **Bias Detection & Ethics:** Built-in "FairHire" logic to detect discrimination in datasets.
- **Agentic Reasoning:** Agents use ReAct (Reason + Act) prompting for logical consistency.
- **Production Ready:** Fully containerized with Docker and served via FastAPI.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Uses SHAP/LIME logic to explain *why* the AI made a certain decision.
